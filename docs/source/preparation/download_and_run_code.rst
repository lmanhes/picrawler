Download and Run the Code
============================

Download the Code Install 3 Libraries
--------------------------------------
We can download the files by using ``git clone`` in the command line.

Install ``robot-hat`` library first.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/
    git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/robot-hat.git
    cd robot-hat
    sudo python3 setup.py install

.. note::
    Running ``setup.py`` will download some necessary components. You may fail to download due to network problems. You may need to download again at this time.
    In the following cases, enter ``Y`` and press Enter.

Then download the code and install ``vilib`` library.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/
    git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/vilib.git
    cd vilib
    sudo python3 setup.py install

Then download the code and install ``picrawler`` library.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/
    git clone -b v2.0 https://github.com/sunfounder/picrawler.git
    cd picrawler
    sudo python3 setup.py install

This step will take a little time, so please be patient.

Finally, you need to run the script ``i2samp.sh`` to install the components required by the i2s amplifier, otherwise the pislot will have no sound.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/picrawler
    sudo bash i2samp.sh
	
.. image:: media/i2s.png

Type y and press Enter to continue running the script.

.. image:: media/i2s2.png

Type y and press Enter to run ``/dev/zero`` in the background.

.. image:: media/i2s3.png

Type y and press Enter to restart the machine.

.. note::
    If there is no sound after restarting, you may need to run the i2samp.sh script multiple times.

Run ``servo_zeroing.py``
--------------------------

Because the servo is powered by the power supply on the Robot HAT, when you only supply power to the Raspberry Pi, the servo will not work. You need to make sure that the batterries are placed in the battery box and the Robot HAT is powered on.

Before you run any code, enable your Raspberry Pi's I2C port, see: :ref:`I2C configuration`.

Now，run the ``servo_zeroing.py`` in the ``examples/`` folder.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/picrawler/examples
    sudo python3 servo_zeroing.py

To make sure you can see that the servo has been set to 0°, you can insert a rocker arm in the servo shaft first and then turn the servo to another angle.

Now follow the diagram below and insert the servo to the P11 position.

    :width: 400
    :align: center

So now if the servo arm returns after the servo arm returns, this function will take effect. If not, If not, please check the insertion direction of the servo cable and re-run the code.

.. note::

    Before assembling each servo, you need to plug the servo pin into P11 and keep the power on.
