How to Calibrate PiCrawler
----------------------------

The calibration page for each product is different, but there are sections that prompt you to calibrate. For PiCrawler, its calibration is more complicated. The calibration steps are as follows:

#. Take out the assembly leaflet, turn it to the last page, and lay it flat on the table. Then place the PiCrawler as shown below, aligning its bottom with the outline on the calibration chart.

#. Go back to EzBlock, select one foot on the left, then click the 3 sets of X, Y and Z buttons, and let the toes slowly align with the calibration point.

   * The calibration buttons are used for fine-tuning, and you need to press these buttons multiple times to see the pin position change.
   * It is recommended to press the R/F key that controls the Z axis to lift the foot, and then adjust the X and Y axes.
