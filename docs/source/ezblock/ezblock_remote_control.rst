In this project, we will learn how to remote control the PiCrawler. 
You can control the PiCrawler to move forward, backward, left, and right.

.. note:: 

    You can refer to :ref:`ezblock:remote_control_latest`. Come and carry out this project smoothly.

**Program**

.. note::

    * You can write the program according to the following picture, please refer to the tutorial: :ref:`ezblock:create_project_latest`.
    * Or find the code with the same name on the **Examples** page of the EzBlock Studio and click **Run** or **Edit** directly.

Switch to the Remote Control interface, and you will see the following widgets.

After the program is running, you can activate PiCrawler through D-Pad.

**How it works?**

After dragging out the widget on the Remote Control interface, a category named **Remote** will appear in the block categories column of the programming interface.

Here we add the D-Pad widget, so the **D-Pad get value** block appears here.

D-Pad can be regarded as a four-in-one button. You can choose which button to read in the second groove of the block.

When the button is pressed, the value is "1"; when the button is not pressed, the value is "0".

We used an **if** block (you can find it in the **Logic** category on the left) to make the PiCrawler move forward once when the **UP** button of the D-pad is pressed.

You can click the gear icon on the upper left of the block to modify the shape of the **if** block to realize multiple judgment branches.

**if** block is usually used with **=** block, **=** block can be modified to **>**, **<** and other conditions through the drop-down menu, please use it flexibly.
