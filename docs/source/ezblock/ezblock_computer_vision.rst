=============================

This project will officially enter the field of computer vision!


.. note:: 
    
    You can read `How to Use the Video Function? <https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/ezblock3/en/latest/use_video.html>`_. Come and carry out this project smoothly.

These two blocks are used to output information. The detection result has five output values, namely coordinate x value, coordinate y value, width, height, and number.
