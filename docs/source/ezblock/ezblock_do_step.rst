Pose â€” Ezblock
===============


PiCrawler can assume a specific posture by writing a coordinate array. Here it assumes a raised right rear foot posture.

**Program**

After opening the example, you can see the following code block.

**How it works?**

In this code, the code you need to pay attention to is this **do step**.

It has two uses:

One: It can directly use **stand** or **sit**.

Second: It can also write an array of 4 coordinate values.

Each foot has an independent coordinate system. As shown below:

You need to measure the coordinates of each toe individually. As shown below:
