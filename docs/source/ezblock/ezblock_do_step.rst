Pose
===============


PiCrawler can assume a specific posture by writing a coordinate array. Here it assumes a raised right rear foot posture.

**Program**

.. note::

    * You can write the program according to the following picture, please refer to the tutorial: :ref:`ezblock:create_project_latest`.
    * Or find the code with the same name on the **Examples** page of the EzBlock Studio and click **Run** or **Edit** directly.

**How it works?**

In this code, the code you need to pay attention to is this **do step**.

It has two uses:

One: It can directly use **stand** or **sit**.

Second: It can also write an array of 4 coordinate values.

Each foot has an independent coordinate system. As shown below:

You need to measure the coordinates of each toe individually. As shown below:
