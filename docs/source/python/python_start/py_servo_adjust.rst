Servo Adjust
===============

To ensure that the servo has been properly set to 0Â°, first insert the rocker arm into the servo shaft and then gently rotate the rocker arm to a different angle.

Follow the instructions on the assembly foldout, insert the battery holder cable and turn the power switch to the ON. Wait for 1-2 minutes, there will be a sound to indicate that the Raspberry Pi boots successfully.

Now, run ``servo_zeroing.py`` in the ``examples/`` folder.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/picrawler/examples
    sudo python3 servo_zeroing.py

Next, plug the servo cable into the P11 port as follows.

At this point you will see the servo arm rotate to a specific position (0Â°). If the servo arm does not return to 0Â°, press the RST button to restart the Robot HAT.

Now you can continue the installation as instructed on the assembly foldout.

.. note::

    * Do not unplug this servo cable before fixing it with the servo screw, you can unplug it after fixing it.
    * Do not rotate the servo while it is powered on to avoid damage; if the servo shaft is not inserted at the right angle, pull the servo out and reinsert it.
    * Before assembling each servo, you need to plug the servo cable into P11 and turn on the power to set its angle to 0Â°.
